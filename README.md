# EcoZib Website

A clean, modern website for EcoZib - a smart waste management solution.

## Project Structure

The project has been restructured for better compatibility and easier deployment:

```
project/
├── css/
│   └── styles.css       # All styles for the website
├── images/              # All images used in the site
└── index.html           # Complete HTML with all sections and inline JS
```

## How it Works

The website now uses a simplified structure:
- All HTML content is directly in index.html
- CSS is kept in a separate file for maintainability
- JavaScript is embedded directly in the HTML file
- No external component loading, making it more reliable across different environments

## Running the Site

Simply open `index.html` in any web browser. No server is needed.

## Advantages of This Structure

1. Simpler deployment - fewer files to manage
2. Better compatibility - works directly from file system without CORS issues
3. Faster loading - no asynchronous component loading delays
4. Less error-prone - no dependencies on component loading mechanisms
